## ðŸ’­ Whose profile is this?

Hi, I'm **JoÃ£o Teixeira**! I'm a **Cybersecurity** student at [EstÃ¡cio](estÃ¡cio.br), and I'm completing my studies at [DIO](https://www.dio.me/)!

_Why am I in this career? I really liked Mr. Robot and Watch Dogs... ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤«_

## ðŸ“… What is the goal of this profile for this year?

I'm currently dedicating myself to being a fullstack in the Web Development area! Given that, my goals in this timeline while I graduate from college are:

- âœ… [DIO GitHub Certification Training Completed](https://hermes.dio.me/certificates/BKONMZIO.pdf)
> _Why start on GitHub? I want to document all my knowledge and use it as a portfolio, and I thought, why not master it right away?_
- Finish the Computational Thinking course at DIO
- Graduate from the Logical Programming Course at DIO
- Graduate from the HTML Web Developer Course at DIO
- Graduate from the CSS Developer Course at DIO
- Graduate from the Javascript Developer Course at DIO
- Graduate from the PHP Experience Course at DIO
- Graduate from the SQL Database Experience Course at DIO

_So that's what I'm doing, studying a little every day after a tiring and satisfying Muay Thai workout (after all, physical fitness and complete knowledge is a combo that I want for myself)_
